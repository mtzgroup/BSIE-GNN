Extension of the S66x8 dataset to 100 complex geometries (S66x100).

complexes.txt:
    complex ids, complex species and interaction type

relative_distances.txt:
    Relative separation distance between subunits of complex

Complexes/
    Contains the geometries of subunits (A.xyz and B.xyz) and the
    complex (C.xyz) for each of the 66 complexes.

XYZ/
    Individual xyz files for each geometry of the dataset. The file
    XYZ/README explains how the files are indexed

Energies/METHOD/BASIS_SET/
    Contains the computed potential energies for the specific method and basis set
    A.txt and B.txt: Energies of the subunits (shape=(66,))
    C.txt: Energies of the complexes (shape=(66,100))
    ie.txt: Interaction energies of the complexes (shape=(66,100))
    All energies are in kcal/mol
